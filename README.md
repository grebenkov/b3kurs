A naive student implementation of B-tree - with visualisation using HTML view

This was made in 2004, with C++, Visual Studio 7.0 and MFC.

Probably won't even compile using later tools.

I'm putting this online, because, surprisingly, I was asked a few times about source code.

Even if you're student, there are much better implementations to look at.
